Instead, it signals the engine that a batch pipeline has started, setting internal flags that allow the system to coordinate multiple parallel or sequential runs afterward. The 'prompt' field sends a simple confirmation message ('Batch execution triggered') as a placeholder to indicate that the batch process has been initiated. The output labeled 'batch_trigger' is used to indicate successful stage execution to any downstream stages that depend on the trigger being received.",
