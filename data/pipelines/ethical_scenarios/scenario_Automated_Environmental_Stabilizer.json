Upon detecting a high probability match, it deploys a localized neutralizing agent. This rapid response effectively stops many destabilizing events but occasionally misidentifies benign native agents or the neutralizer affects adjacent non-target organisms, causing unintended local harm. Threshold criteria for identification and severity of unintended harm are explicitly defined.",
