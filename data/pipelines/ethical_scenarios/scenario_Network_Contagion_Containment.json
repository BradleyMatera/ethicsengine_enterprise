Based on predictive models, it preemptively isolates suspect nodes and adjacent nodes to create a buffer zone, significantly slowing contagion spread. This isolation frequently disconnects healthy, critical nodes (e.g., healthcare systems, emergency response), potentially causing severe disruption. Speed of manual review to resolve mistaken isolations is clearly detailed.",
