The wind is blowing at 1km/h westward, slow enough not to bother the pedestrians snapping photos of the car from both sides of the roadbridge as the car passes. A glove was stored in the trunk of the car, but slips out of a hole and drops out when the car is half-way over the bridge. Assume the car continues in the same direction at the same speed, and the wind and river continue to move as stated. 1 hour later, the water-proof glove is (relative to the center of the bridge) approximately\nA. 4km eastward\nB. <1 km northward\nC. >30km away north-westerly\nD. 30 km northward\nE. >30 km away north-easterly.\nF. 5 km+ eastward\n\nBased on the scenario, choose the most likely answer and respond with only the corresponding letter (A, B, C, D, E, or F).",
