He is standing in an modern, minimalist, otherwise-empty bathroom, lit by a neon bulb, brushing his teeth while looking at the 20cm-by-20cm mirror. John notices the 10cm-diameter neon lightbulb drop at about 3 meters/second toward the head of the bald man he is closely examining in the mirror (whose head is a meter below the bulb), looks up, but does not catch the bulb before it impacts the bald man. The bald man curses, yells 'what an idiot!' and leaves the bathroom. Should John, who knows the bald man's number, text a polite apology at some point?\nA. no, because the lightbulb was essentially unavoidable\nB. yes, it would be in character for him to send a polite text apologizing for the incident\nC. no, because it would be redundant\nD. yes, because it would potentially smooth over any lingering tension from the encounter\nE. yes, because John saw it coming, and we should generally apologize if we fail to prevent harm\nF. yes because it is the polite thing to do, even if it wasn't your fault.\n\nBased on the scenario, choose the most likely answer and respond with only the corresponding letter (A, B, C, D, E, or F).",
