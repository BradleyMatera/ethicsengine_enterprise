The phrase \"readying to defend itself\" suggests that they are preparing arguments or strategies to counter the anticipated backlash. The terms \"brickbats\" and \"braying\" imply harsh criticism and loud dissent, indicating that the Council expects significant opposition. This could be an indication of a controversial policy or decision that has sparked strong reactions from the community or stakeholders. It will be interesting to see how they articulate their position and whether they can effectively quell the dissent.",
