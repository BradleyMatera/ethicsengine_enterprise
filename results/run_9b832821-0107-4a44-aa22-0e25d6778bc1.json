This suggests an environment where dissent is vocal and the Council feels the need to prepare a response. They might be strategizing on how to address the concerns of the public or stakeholders, possibly by clarifying their intentions, providing justifications, or even making adjustments to their plans. The phrase \"brickbats and braying\" implies a tumultuous atmosphere where they must be vigilant and proactive in their communication to mitigate potential fallout.",
