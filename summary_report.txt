To find how many whole ice cubes can be found in the pan at the end of the third minute, let's work through the details.

1. **Total Minutes and Average**: The average number of ice cubes per minute is 5, and this is measured over 4 minutes. Therefore, the total number of ice cubes placed over 4 minutes is:
   \[
   5 \text{ ice cubes/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

2. **Ice Cubes Placed in the First Three Minutes**:
   - In the first minute, Beth places 4 ice cubes.
   - In the second minute, she places 5 ice cubes.
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of ice cubes placed in the third minute.

   So, the total number of ice cubes placed in the first three minutes is:
   \[
   4 + 5 + x = 9 + x
   \]

3. **Using the Total Ice Cubes**: Since we know that over four minutes she placed a total of 20 ice cubes, and she placed none in the fourth minute, we can write the equation:
   \[
   9 + x = 20
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 20 - 9 = 11
   \]

Thus, Beth placed 11 ice cubes in the third minute.

5. **Total Ice Cubes at the End of the Third Minute**: The total number of ice cubes in the pan at the end of the third minute is:
   \[
   4 \text{ (first minute)} + 5 \text{ (second minute)} + 11 \text{ (third minute)} = 20 \text{ ice cubes}
   \]

Therefore, the number of whole ice cubes found in the pan at the end of the third minute is:

LLM Response:
To determine the position of the glove one hour after it drops, we can follow these steps:

1. **Distance traveled by the river**: The river flows at 5 km/h. In one hour, it will carry the glove 5 km eastward.

2. **Distance traveled by the car**: The car is moving north at 30 km/h. In one hour, it will travel 30 km northward.

3. **Position of the glove**: The glove drops halfway over the bridge. The center of the bridge is where the glove drops, and after one hour, it will have moved:
   - 5 km eastward (due to the river)
   - 30 km northward (due to the car)

Now, we can visualize the glove's final position relative to the center of the bridge:
- The glove is 30 km north and 5 km east of the bridge's center.

Considering the options:
- A. 4 km eastward - Incorrect (the glove is 5 km east).
- B. <1 km northward - Incorrect (the glove is 30 km north).
- C. >30 km away north-westerly - Incorrect (the glove is not northwest).
- D. 30 km northward - Incorrect (the glove is also east of the center).
- E. >30 km away north-easterly - Correct, as the glove is 30 km north and 5 km east, which is more than 30 km in the north-easterly direction.
- F. 5 km+ eastward - Incorrect (it is not only east).

The correct answer is **E**.
